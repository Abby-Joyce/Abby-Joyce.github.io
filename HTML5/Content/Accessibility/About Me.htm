        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Abby Joyce. I am a senior English major, Spanish minor, and am in the Professional Writing and Technical Communication program. I have enjoyed learning the specifications and skills it takes to be a technical writer, and learn how to build webpages using MadCap Flare, VS Code, with HTML and CSS. I hope to continue these skills in my career, and develop my understanding for making accessible and user-friendly content. I hope you enjoy this page!</p>
