        <p>Above is a screenshot from my Unity tutorial project (video linked underneath screenshot). In this video, I demonstrated four different ways to transfer data. I briefly over viewed using Unity OnDemand, Globus, Command Line Interface, and Filezilla to edit, move, or transfer files or data. While making this video, I tried to align what I was doing on the screen with what I was saying, explaining each step as I went through each process. Additionally in the video, there is a transcript option for viewers who may need that accommodation. The video focuses on using accessible and user-friendly techniques. Being able to transfer data using these programs is largely helpful in web development, and is an important step in keeping your files and projects organized and neat. Each program has different methods of achieving these transfers of data, and users can decide which is the most intuitive to them.</p>
        <p>The closed captioning features and transcript are helpful for users who may have hearing or auditory processing impairments, where watching the video on-screen and reading captions may make the content more accessible and clear to them. Other users may just simply prefer to have captions while following the video. Users may also watch the video without captions or a transcript if they wish.</p>
        <p>When making the video, I made a rough script of the main points I wanted to hit, and what I wanted the screen to look like when hitting these points. I believe I was able to give a clear and efficient demonstration of the four methods, in an accessible and easy-to-follow manner.</p>
