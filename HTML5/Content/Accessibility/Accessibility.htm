        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        <p>This webpage will address the need for accessibility within web and content development. As the digital and media-focused age continues to grow in technology and online, it is a crucial factor in developing these mediums. Accessibility is the idea that everyone, regardless of their physical, mental, or otherwise capabilities can use the website or web platform with ease and the same understanding as an able-bodied person. </p>
        <p>Accessibility as a whole, can encompass many different features on a webpage including visual aids, verbal aids, maneuvers that are physically accessible, and many others that web developers often do not consider. Understanding disability is important when addressing these issues, and how it can come in many different forms. Disabilities will not always be visible, and many may struggle with obstacles that able-bodied people do not see or do not understand. Open-mindedness when making accessible content, and being able to adapt to obstacles to achieve usability for the most amount of people possible are important skills to maintain when making accessible content. "Disability,"&#160;from Adobe Inclusive Design Workshop explains this idea. It says, “As you work with people with disabilities, it's critical to know that all of these variables are in effect, and not to associate disability only with what is visible—whether that's a wheelchair, a white cane, or a hearing aid” (9). This encapsulates what web developers must keep in mind when making content accessible. Even if disabilities are beyond our understanding, it is important to be malleable and creative, to ensure usability and comfort for all users, regardless of their abilities, whether apparent or invisible or to any degree.</p>
        <p>Accessibility is something that affects so many people, but is often not discussed enough, or on the priority forefront of content creators. Whether someone is an expert in accessible design or not, every person can do their part to understand obstacles that people with disabilities face daily, on and off the web. By beginning to recognize these disparities, we can re-frame our thinking to understand these difficulties on the web, and how to solve these obstacles, and make them easier to access and use. Laura Kalbag comments on this in her chapter, "Considering Accessibility,"&#160;and says, “We do need experts for their specialized knowledge and guidance, but there aren't enough accessibility experts in the world to leave the task of building an accessible web in their hands alone. That's why it's up to us-you, me, designers and developers, writers and information architects, everyone-to make the web a fairer place” (Kalbag 17) </p>
        <p>People need to begin to understand what disabilities are, and how people with them struggle to operate their daily lives in large ways (working, traveling, eating, driving, etc, ) that able-bodied people often do not think twice about. Once this understanding is reached, web accessibility will receive the attention it deserves, to address the difficulties people with disabilities face when trying to operate the web, and to make content that is user-friendly, efficient, and accessible to all, regardless of ability. </p>
